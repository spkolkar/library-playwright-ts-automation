Book Management – Playwright Automation
This project contains automated UI tests for a Book Management web application using Playwright + TypeScript.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clean, scalable automation framework using:
    • Page Object Model (POM)
    • Step Layer abstraction
    • Reusable BasePage utilities
    • Stable locator strategy
    • Clean test structure


🧱 Project Structure

│
├── pages/        → Page Object classes
├── steps/        → Business logic layer
├── specs/        → Test cases
│
├── BasePage.ts   → Common reusable methods
└── playwright.config.ts

Architecture Overview
    • Specs contain test scenarios only
    • Steps contain test flow logic
    • Pages contain UI interaction methods
    • BasePage contains reusable helpers (header validation, row search, etc.)
This keeps the tests readable and easy to maintain.


🚀 Technologies Used
    • Playwright
    • TypeScript
    • Node.js

🧪 Test Coverage
Currently implemented scenarios:
    • ✅ Add new book
    • ✅ Edit existing book
    • ✅ Validate header visibility
    • ✅ Row search and interaction
    • ⏳ Delete book (optional / future enhancement)

🏗 Design Decisions
1️⃣ ID-Based Locators
Where possible, input fields use unique IDs for stable and reliable selectors.
Example:

this.page.locator('#title')
This avoids brittle text-based selectors.

2️⃣ Separation of Concerns
Instead of writing UI actions directly inside tests:
    • Tests describe what
    • Pages implement how
This keeps the test cases clean and readable.

3️⃣ Explicit Page Validation
Before interacting with forms, the framework validates that the correct page header is visible.
This prevents flaky timing issues during navigation.

📌 Example Test

test('Edit existing book successfully', async ({ page }) => {
  const booksSteps = new BooksPageSteps(page);
await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/books');
await booksSteps.editBookFlow(
    'Atomic Habits',
    'Atomic Habits - Updated',
    '35.99'
  );
});

🔮 Future Improvements
Possible enhancements:
    • Data-driven testing
    • API mocking
    • CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)
    • Environment configuration support
    • Dockerized test execution
